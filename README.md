# fruit-or-vegetable-prediction
Simple machine learning algorithm for predicting whether an item is a fruit or vegetable.

I made this program to help learn how ML packages perform the training of models and prediction.

Instead of using ML packages to do this task I use numpy to allow me to perform matrix multiplication. The ML algorithm used is the simple Perceptron Learning Algorithm with 2 features (calories, carbohydrates) for a 100g serving of a fruit or vegetable.
